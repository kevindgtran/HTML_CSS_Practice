      <ins>RELATIVE</ins> - Now for a bit of a recap on CSS and HTML boxes, as discussed in my [floats and clearing article]. An HTML document consists of a number of elements interspersed with character data (text). When such a document is rendered on a computer screen or printed on paper, those elements generate rectangular boxes. Just as the set of HTML elements is divided into block-level elements and inline elements, boxes in CSS are essentially either block boxes or inline boxes.

    <p class="second">
      By default, the built-in user agent style sheet in a browser makes block-level HTML elements such as p and div generate block boxes, while inline elements such as strong and span generate inline boxes. We can control the type of box that is generated using the display property.
    </p>
    <p class="third">
      The boxes generated by the elements in a document are laid out according to a clearly defined set of rules in the CSS2.1 specification. Those rules are written for the relatively few people who write browser software to learn how CSS works though, not for those of us who design web pages for a living—or a hobby. This is why this entire course exists! As a result, the specification can be a bit difficult to understand. In this article I’ll try to explain the basics in a way that is better suited for web designers and developers.
