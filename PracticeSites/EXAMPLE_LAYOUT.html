      <h1>WOODWORKING FOREVER</h1>
      <p>
        The Art of Woodworking is a long series published in the 90's. Each volume details specific tools, skills, or techniques used to work with wood or specific things to build out of wood. I haven't read any of them yet, though I can honestly say that if I read one of these and successfully built something it would be a shining beacon to the others out there who are, like me, mechanically disinclined. One thing I don't like about them is that they are spiral bound under the front covers, which seems almost deceptive to me, but if the content is valuable I'd work around it.
